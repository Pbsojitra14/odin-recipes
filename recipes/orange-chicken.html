        <!-- Step 1-->
        <li>Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. 
            Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring to a boil.

        <!-- Step 2-->
        <li>
            Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. 
            Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
            Reserve the remaining sauce.
        </li>
        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <li>
            Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.

            Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. 
            Seal the bag and shake to coat.
        </li>
        <!-- Step 5 -->
        <li>
            Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides. 
            Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.

            Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth.

            stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
